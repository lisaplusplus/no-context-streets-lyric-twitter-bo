= Overview
Pregenerated lyricList.txt included. This set of scripts regenerates lyricList.txt if ran in the correct order.
It shouldn't really be necesary, but they are handy if the input data turns out to be faulty or to provide a
starting point should a better source appear.

= Requirements
Python 3

Beautiful Soup

Curl

Bash
